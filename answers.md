- **2)** Write a recurrence for the **work** of this algorithm and solve it. Assume the input is $n$ to compute $F_n$.

- **3)** Write a recurrence for the **span** of this algorithm and solve it.

- **4)** Inspecting the `counts` list, what interesting pattern emerges?

- **6)** When computing $F_n$, what is the maximum number of times that `fib_top_down(i)` will be called for any value $i$? Based on this, what is the **work** and **span** of this algorithm?

- **8)** When computing $F_n$, what is the maximum number of times that
  $F_i$ will be read from the list for any value $i$? Based on this, what is the **work** and **span** of `fib_bottom_up`?
